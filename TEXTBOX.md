Design patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems that arise during the process of designing something. These patterns can be found in a variety of fields, including architecture, engineering, and software development, as well as in everyday objects found in our homes.

Let's start with examples of design patterns found in homes. Hinges, knobs, and switches are all examples of design patterns that serve a specific purpose. Hinges, for example, are a common pattern used in doors and cabinets to allow them to swing open and closed. Knobs are used to open and close doors and drawers, while switches are used to turn lights on and off. These patterns are used over and over again because they are effective and efficient solutions to common problems.

In English, design patterns can be seen in the structure of sentences and paragraphs. For example, the "subject-verb-object" pattern is a common sentence structure that is used to convey information in a clear and concise manner. In paragraphs, the "topic sentence-supporting details-concluding sentence" pattern is often used to organize information in a logical way.

In software development, design patterns are used to solve common problems that arise in software design. For example, the "Model-View-Controller" pattern is a common design pattern used to separate the concerns of user interface, data storage, and application logic in a software application. Another example is the "Factory Method" pattern, which is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

Living organisms also consist of design patterns. All living organisms consist of one or more cells and the information used to construct these cells and how they work together is encapsulated in DNA. This is the fundamental design pattern of all life. Within DNA is the information that is used to build and maintain all living organisms. This information is encoded in the sequence of nucleotides that make up the DNA molecule. DNA consists of multiple nested and integrated design patterns. One of the design patterns nested within DNA is the coding sequence. Coding sequences make up about 2% of DNA and they specify the design of proteins.Coding sequences are made up of codons which are nucleotide-triplets. Since there are 4 types of nucleotides there are 64 (4x4x4) types of codons. Amongs these codons is 1 start codon, 3 stop codons, and 60 other codons. Each coding sequences begins with the start codon and ends with one of the three stop codons. Each of these coding sequences are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and mRNA is translated into functional proteins.

The process of transcription involves copying the DNA coding sequence into a mRNA molecule. This mRNA molecule contains a sequence of nucleotides that is complementary to the DNA sequence, with the exception that RNA uses uracil (U) instead of thymine (T). The mRNA molecule is then transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, where it is translated into a protein.

The process of translation involves reading the mRNA code and using it to assemble a protein. This is done by matching the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA molecule to a sequence of three nucleotides called a codon. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid, which is the building block of proteins. The translation process begins with a start codon, which signals the beginning of protein synthesis, and ends with a stop codon, which signals the end.

Nested within the assembled proteins are more design patterns such as alpha helixes, beta sheets and beta turns. Also proteins integrate with one another and other molecules to build complex structures and perform complex chemical reactions.
