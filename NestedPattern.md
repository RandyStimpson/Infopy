To illustrated a nested design pattern, the outer pattern will be the same design pattern in the previous view. The inner pattern will consist of a semi-palendrome. In the center will be 4 random characters. On the sides of the center there must be at least 4 sets of characters that match the other side, as shown in the examples below. Note that this pattern resembles the common RNA pattern of a hairpin loop, where the 4 random characters in the center are the loop. For this reason, we will refer to the parts of the semi-palendrome as the stem (matching sides) and the loop.

The inner patterns are said to be integrated if the loop portion matches a segment of the stem. Note that the loop can match more that one stem and that the longer the stem the higher the probability that it will integrate with a loop.
